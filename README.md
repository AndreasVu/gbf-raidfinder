This is my attempt at creating a simple raidfinder for Granblue Fantasy using Angular and Node.js.

This project is far from finished, and need a lot ot polishing and tweaks.

## Development server
Running the app:
1. Download [node](https://nodejs.org/en/)
2. Install the angular CLI with the command `npm install -g @angular/cli`
3. Run `npm install` in the root folder, and the `/server` folder
4. Add your Twitter API keys and tokens in the `/server/settings.json` file
5. Run `ng serve` in the root folder, and `npm start` in the `/server folder`


## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
