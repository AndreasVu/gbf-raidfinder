# Raidfinder

This is my attempt at creating a simple raidfinder for Granblue Fantasy using Angular and node.

This project is far from finished, and need a lot ot polishing and tweaks.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
Run `npm start` inside the `/server` folder to run the server.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
